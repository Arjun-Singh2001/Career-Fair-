You can run the project using npm start to start local server on port 3000 and npm install to acquire the node_modules folder. The reason being the node modules is not there initally is so that the download doesn't take a long time. Only the owner's wallet address (me) can add/delete companies. Other users would need a MetaMask wallet account to register/unregister and need some ETH in their wallet to process for gas fees. You can check DevTools to ensure an ETH wallet is detected on the backend environment. If you choose to create a wallet account, ensure your security key is kept secret; it should not be shared with anyone. The wallet address itself is fine. For others who wish to view the project, creating a wallet is completely up to you, but my recommendation is looking more into the UI components and web design rather than creating a wallet itself. Enjoy! :)
